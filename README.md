# UI
Base for all kind of UI components used on an almost daily basis.


## Elements

- [ ] Accordion
- [X] Carousel
- [X] Lightbox
- [X] Slider

## Documentation

Run this command to install all the necessary packages to run the Gulp file.

```bash
$ npm install
```

After that run the Gulp command to create the documentation

```bash
$ gulp docs
```

There will appear a docs directory in the project root.


## Browser support

Basically the components are meant to be working in IE8+ and all modern browsers, since it leans mostly on CSS. This could however mean you'll have to use transitions if you want things to  animate, in which case the browser support will change into IE10+ and all other modern browsers. But that ofcourse is all up to you.
